# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a **Machine Learning** project aimed at predicting whether a patient is at risk of diabetes, using two different classifiers:
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately predict diabetes risk based on patient medical data, and to compare the effectiveness of Random Forest and SVM classifiers.

---

## 📥 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, obtained from Kaggle:

- [Diabetes Data Set by mathchi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

### Features included in the dataset:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Genetic risk factor
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Diabetes (1: yes, 0: no)

- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
